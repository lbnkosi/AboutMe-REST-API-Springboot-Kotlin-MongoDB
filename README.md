# Portfolio REST API | Springboot | Kotlin
For one of my projects, I wanted to build an Android portfolio app which I could deploy to the Google Play Store.

One of the issues I faced was, what backend do I use. My mind instantly jumped to Firebase due to how robust and easy to setup it is. However, I figured it would be more fun to build my own backend from scratch using SpringBoot.


## Languages, libraries and tools used

* Kotlin
* SpringBoot
* MongoDb
* IntelliJ
* Docker
* Amazon Web Services

## Note

* If you fork this, don't forget to setup a MongoDb database and add your mongodb config to SimpleMongoConfig.kt and application.properties files with the following line: mongodb+srv://<name>:<password>B@cluster0.lwsvj.mongodb.net/myFirstDatabase?retryWrites=true&w=majority
