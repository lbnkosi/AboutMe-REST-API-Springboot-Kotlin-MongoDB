# Portfolio REST API | Springboot | Kotlin
For one of my projects, I wanted to build an Android portfolio app which I could deploy to the Google Play Store.

One of the issues I faced was, what backend do I use. My mind instantly jumped to Firebase due to how robust and easy to setup it is. However, I figured it would be more fun to build my own backend from scratch using SpringBoot.
